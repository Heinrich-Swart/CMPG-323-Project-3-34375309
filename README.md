# Repositories

Created a Generic -, Category -, Zone -, and Device repository that contains the methods to use throughout

# Controllers

Created a Generic -, Category -, Zone -, and Device controller that contains all the UPDATE, DELETE and ADD methods so that it can update to the database

# Interface

Created a Generic -, Category -, Zone -, and Device interface classes that contains methods that can be added so that you can see all the data from the database.

# Reasons

The program is created to retrieve, display or edit data from a hosted database so that you can remotely make changes. This is useful as many people that is registered and logged in, can make changes/add data that the database consist of.

 # Struggles

 I struggled with the repositories and Interface class as it is the first time I was working directly with it. With that said, I learned alot, had a few issues like not being sure if it is connect to the database, aswell as same errors with the repositories. 

 Atleast a few google searches helped alot with the issues.

 # "Not sure"

 I am not sure if I implemented the Generic Repository and Generic Interface class in the correct manner, but when I tested everything, it was working as intended
